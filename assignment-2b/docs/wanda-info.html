        WandaVision premiered with its first two episodes on January 15, 2021, and ran for nine episodes, concluding on March 5. It is the first series, and beginning, of Phase Four of the MCU. The series received praise from critics for its recreation of past sitcoms and for the performances of its cast, especially Olsen's, though there was criticism for the finale. It was widely discussed and analyzed by fans based on various popular theories, as well as by commentators for its exploration of grief and nostalgia. The series has received numerous accolades, including 23 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, winning three. WandaVision directly sets up the film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022), in which Olsen reprises her role as Maximoff, while a spin-off series is in development, with Hahn returning as Agatha Harkness and Schaeffer writing and executive producing.

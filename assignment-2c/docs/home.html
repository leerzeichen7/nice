                Released on: 20-Nov-2021<br/>
                The agonizing ending to Arcane brings to a close one of this year’s best animated projects. There’s been an incredible amount of care and attention put into this and the final episode finally sees our blue-haired vixen embrace her Jinx persona.
                <br/><br/>Vi remains on the edge here, torn between doing right by the Undercity and trying to salvage her sister. The trouble is, Silco’s death serves as a martyr that pushes her over the edge and prevents the girl from ever becoming like she was.
                <br/><br/>The ending with the dinner is a great way of showing how far Jinx has descended and it’s a brilliantly poetic move that echoes that of the Mad Hatter and his tea party. There’s definitely shades of influence there and that ending, with her rocket flying through the council, is akin to tumbling down the rabbit hole of war. There will undoubtedly be massive repercussions to come….if this is renewed for a second season and we see the fallout.

                Released on: 20-Nov-2021<br/>
                Arcane’s penultimate episode starts to align all the moving parts as the finale looks set to pull the trigger and explode into all-out war. Seeing Ekko alive is a nice touch, as is Heimerdinger walking through the streets of the Undercity and seeing firsthand the devastation and chaos that’s gripped the nation.
                <br/><br/>The Council, unfortunately, stick to their ways and despite Jayce’s radical ideas, aren’t enough to stop what’s coming. The border issue has been an interesting way of showing that some political ideas can have serious consequences, with Jinx the obvious wildcard in all of this.
                <br/><br/>We haven’t seen what she looks like or what’s happened since her surgery so it’ll be interesting to see this, especially as the ending hints that Caitlyn is about to find out first-hand.

                Released on: 14-Jul-2021<br/>
                Wild! Loki is trapped in some weird version of the TVA. The original Mobius and Hunter B-15 are either altered or back in their original timeline. Sylvie is still up in that cosmic castle, perhaps she will step up and fill that void she was so worried Loki would scoop up? There’s also Judge Ravonna who got some kind of information from He Who Remains and is on a mission to do… something. There’s also Miss Minutes who I think we can all agree is super shady and has a lot more involvement than we currently see. Also, what happened to Casey?

                Released on: 23-Apr-2021<br/>
                The finale opens where the last episode ended — a lockdown at the GRC. Bucky is there already, Sam is on the way, and even Sharon has made it into the country, bringing along some nifty Ethan Hunt disguise tech that hasn’t been seen since Natasha used it in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. (It’s called a Photostatic Veil, if you’re curious.) It turns out, Karli was waiting for Sam to get there to start the fireworks. Sam flies through a window (heroes don’t take doors), and says, “I’m Captain America.” Hell yeah, you are. Karli tries to talk Bucky out of fighting for the wrong side, but he’s deep in his feelings, talking about the nightmares of who he has killed in the past, trying to warn Karli that she will someday have the same.

                Meanwhile “Faux” Vision shows up, almost crushing Wanda’s head like a tin can and our beloved Vision knocks him out of the way. They end up fighting in the sky, right next to the top of the hex that is separating. Of course, these weapons are also men of intellect. They stop their fighting and being to talk about why things are happening. The true Vision explains to our powder-looking friend he is a weapon that will be controlled; he will have no free will. He gives him the magical touch and unlocks the real Vision’s memories, the one with empathy for humans. As they float in a library that strangely looks like Dr. Strange’s house, the great white hope flies through the ceiling and into the sky.

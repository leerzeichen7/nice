                Arcane (titled onscreen as Arcane: League of Legends) is an animated action-adventure-drama series created by Christian Linke and Alex Yee for <a class="series-href" href="https://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a>. Produced by Fortiche under the supervision of Riot Games, it is set in the League of Legends fictional universe, and primarily focuses on sisters Vi and Jinx. The series was announced at the League of Legends 10th anniversary celebration in 2019, and first released in November 2021.
                <br/><br/>Based on the world behind League of Legends, Arcane dives into the delicate balance between the rich, utopian city of Piltover Crest and the seedy, oppressed underground of Zaun Crest. Known across Runeterra as the "city of progress," many of the most brilliant minds call these cities home. But the creation of hextech, a way for any person to control magical energy, threatens that balance. The story follows the origins of two iconic League champions-and the power that will tear them apart. Like the game on which it is based, Arcane is aimed at a "16+" audience and will deal with some more adult subject matter.

They give Loki a choice: face being erased from existence due to being a "time variant", or help fix the timeline and stop a greater threat. Loki ends up trapped in his own crime thriller, traveling through time.
